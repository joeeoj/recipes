## notes

* Good, even with newly made rice
* Tuscan kale: Tuscan kale goes by many names. Among them are dinosaur kale, cavolo nero, and black kale. This kale has longer spear-like leaves with a pebbled appearance and a dark, mottled green color. Its flavor is deep and earthy - itâ€™s less bitter than curly leafed, with an almost-nutty sweetness.
