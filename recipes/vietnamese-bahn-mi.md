## ingredients

* 10 oz beef tenderloin
* 6 tbsp hoisin sauce
* 6 tbsp rice wine vinegar
* 2 teaspoons minced garlic
* 2 tbsp fish sauce
* 1 medium carrot, thinly sliced

* 1/4 cup mayo
* 1/2 cup cilantro leaves and stems

## steps

Prep

1. Preheat oven to 425°. Place pork tenderloin into the freezer for 15 minutes; this will make it easier to slice thinly.

Cook

1. Slice frozen tenderloin as thinly as possible. Transfer to a medium bowl, add 3 tablespoons hoisin sauce, 3 tablespoons rice vinegar, garlic, and fish sauce to bowl; mix until well combined. Let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes.

2. Toss carrot and daikon with remaining vinegar and salt; let sit at room temperature until ready to use. In a large cast-iron skillet on medium high, heat oil and add marinated pork. Cook without stirring for 4 minutes. Give it a toss and continue to cook 1 minute.

3. Toast baguette in oven for 10 minutes until golden brown. Spread mayonnaise on bottom half and remaining hoisin sauce on top half. Layer pork, then pickled veggies and cilantro on bottom half. Place on the top half and slice cross wise before serving.
