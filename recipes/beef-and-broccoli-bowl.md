Sous vide (optional)

3. Cook for 90 minutes at 131 F
4. Once done, remove from bag and pat dry
5. Heat a cast iron to super hot with some canola oil and sear each side for exactly 1 minute
6. Let rest and then slice (1/4in x 2in) and add to everything else at the end to warm it back up

Prep

1. Slice steak in pieces 1/4 inch thick and 2 inches long (if not using sous vide)
2. Rinse and cut broccoli

Cook

_start with about 15 minutes left on the sous vide_

## notes

* Healthy things to swap in:
    * brown rice for jasmine rice
    * arrowroot powder instead of cornstarch
    * fake sugar (stevia in the raw or coconut sugar) instead of real sugar
    * low sodium beef stock and soy sauce
