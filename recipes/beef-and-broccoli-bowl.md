* 1 lb steak (sirloin or lean flank)
* 3 or 4 heads of broccoli
* 1/2 cup beef stock
* lime (garnish)
* green onion (garnish)
* jasmine rice
* 1.5 tbsp olive oil
* 1.5 tbsp minced garlic

sauce

* 1 tbsp ginger
* 3 tbsp soy sauce
* 3 tbsp sugar
* 2 tbsp corn starch (stir in at the end with an ice cube to avoid clumping)

## steps

Sous vide (optional)

1. Make diagonal slices in both sides of the meat about 1/4 inch deep and generously salt and pepper
2. Seal with water displacement
3. Cook for 90 minutes at 131 F
4. Once done, remove from bag and pat dry
5. Heat a cast iron to super hot with some canola oil and sear each side for exactly 1 minute
6. Let rest and then slice (1/4in x 2in) and add to everything else at the end to warm it back up

Prep

1. Start rice
2. Slice steak in pieces 1/4 inch thick and 2 inches long (if not using sous vide)
3. Rinse and cut broccoli
4. Mince ginger

Cook

_start with about 15 minutes left on the sous vide_

1. Start rice
2. Make sauce and set aside but don't add the cornstarch yet
3. Heat large nonstick skillet or wok over medium heat and add olive oil. After hot cook garlic for 1-2 minutes.

## notes

* Healthy things to swap in:
    * brown rice for jasmine rice
    * arrowroot powder instead of cornstarch
    * fake sugar (stevia in the raw or coconut sugar) instead of real sugar
    * low sodium beef stock and soy sauce
