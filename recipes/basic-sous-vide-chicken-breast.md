# Basic Sous Vide Chicken Breast

Chicken that doesn't taste like rubber

## info

* 2 hours
* Cooks for 1 but can be scaled up however much you want and makes good leftovers

## ingredients

* 2 4-oz chicken breasts
* 4 slices of lemon (2 per chicken breast)
* 1 rosemary sprig (1 per bag)
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* pepper
* salt

## steps

1. Set sous vide to 145 F
2. Season both sides of chicken breasts with salt and pepper and some olive oil
3. Add lemon slices and rosemary
4. Vacuum seal
5. Cook for 1.5 to 2 hours
6. Sear for 1-2 minutes per side on a hot cast iron (with olive oil) when done

## notes

* Don't seal with the lemons direclty on the chicken otherwise it will indent into the chicken and make it look weird
* You'll want to cut the chicken breasts in half lengthwise unless you get thinly slice chicken breasts in which case cook for the minimum time
* If using frozen chicken breasts add 1/2 the time to the original (per Chef Steps) so 1.5 hours becomes 2.25 hours
