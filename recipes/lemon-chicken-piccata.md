# lemon chicken piccata

Lemon chicken piccata served with pasta

## info

* 30ish
* Depends how much chicken is used (each portion centers around one) but around 4-6 meals

## ingredients

roughly in the order of my grocery store

* 1 shallot
* 2 cloves garlic, mined
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves
* Juice of 1 large lemon
* 1 or 2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut crosswise in half
* 3/4 cup chicken broth
* 1/4 cup capers, drained
* 1 pound spaghetti (or thin spaghetti or angel hair)
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
* 1/4 cup dry white wine (or substitute with more chicken broth)

## steps

Prep

1. Start boiling water for pasta
2. Dice shallot
3. Juice lemon
4. Chop parsley
5. Prep plate or pan with 1/2 cup flour for dredging chicken

Cook

1. Cook pasta, strain, and put back into pot with some olive oil to reduce sticking
2. Season chicken with salt and pepper, to taste. Working one at a time, dredge chicken in flour
3. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add chicken and cook, flipping once, until cooked through, about 4-5 minutes on each side. Set aside and keep warm (skip if chicken pre-cooked in sous vide)
4. Stir in 1/4 cup chicken broth, 3/4 cup wine, and all the lemon juice. Cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes
5. Gradually whisk in 1/2 cup heavy cream until slightly thickened, about 3-4 minutes
6. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir in capers
7. Serve immediately with pasta and chicken, garnished with parsley, if desired

## notes

* Pro tip for perfect chicken every time
    * buy frozen chicken breast from Costco
    * sous vide at 149 F for 1.5 hours **in the original packaging**
    * Sear on high heat in a cast iron for 1 minute each side with some olive oil (do not need to dredge)
    * Once the sauce is mostly done put the chicken in the pan and turn to low for 5 minutes to warm them back up
