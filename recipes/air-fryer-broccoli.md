# Air Fryer Broccoli

Quick and easy crisp-tender broccoli in under 10 minutes

## info

* 12 minutes (3 min prep, 9 min cook)
* 4 servings

## ingredients

* 1 head broccoli
* 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper

## steps

Prep

1. Cut broccoli into florets

Cook

1. Preheat air fryer to 390 F
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine broccoli florets, olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper
3. Toss until broccoli is evenly coated
4. Transfer broccoli to air fryer basket in a single layer (cook in batches if needed to avoid crowding)
5. Air fry for 7-9 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through
6. Check for doneness at 8 minutes - broccoli should be crisp-tender with lightly browned edges

## notes

* Avoid crowding the basket - cook in batches if necessary to prevent steaming instead of air frying
* For softer, steamed broccoli rather than crispy texture, add 1 tbsp water to the air fryer basket before cooking
* Optimal cook time is around 8 minutes; check doneness when shaking basket halfway through
